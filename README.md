# ListAssist
## What is it?
This was a rudimentary shopping list application that I designed as, at the time, I couldn't find a suitable program that wasn't too bloated that suited my exact needs. Since then, I've started using Google Keep which has most of everything I need.

## Basic Features
* Multiple lists
* Tickable list of items in each list
* Screen keep-alive feature
* Uses built-in (to Android) sqlLite database

## Programming Language
It was written using Basic4Android, and the end program works on Android-based devices.
